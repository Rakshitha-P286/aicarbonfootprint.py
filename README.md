# Carbon Footprint Calculator 🐾🌍

A Python tool to estimate your personal carbon footprint based on activities like transportation, energy use, and daily habits.  
This project was created as an internship assignment to introduce sustainable computing and help users understand how their everyday choices impact the environment.


## 🚀 About the Project

This script calculates the **estimated carbon emissions** of a person using basic factors like travel distance, energy consumption, and lifestyle habits.  
It’s written in Python and hosted as a public repository on GitHub.

- Helps users estimate their carbon footprint
- Can be extended to include more data sources and emission factors
- Useful for learning environmental programming concepts


## 📌 Features

- Accepts user inputs for activity data
- Computes carbon footprint based on predefined emission factors
- Outputs estimated carbon emission (in kg CO₂)
- Lightweight and easy to run locally


## 🔧 How It Works

The script uses emission factors (e.g., kg CO₂ per KM for cars) to calculate total emissions. You can easily edit or add more activities based on your data or research. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}


## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **Python** – Core language  
- **Jupyter Notebook / .py script** – For running the calculator
